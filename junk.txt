This is just a bit of junk to populate this folder for a git test.

A fresh empty repository has been made in dormouseroared on github.

1. In local, git add . then git commit -m "first commit" to create a local repo with something in it.

2. push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/dormouseroared/git-test-1.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

3. check on github that the repo is updated.

4. Update the repo on github.

5. update the local repo.
